A little background on who I am and why I've created this site.

I spent 20 years coding professionally in various languages, including Pascal, C, C++, Eiffel, Erlang, Java, PHP, Perl, C# and several others.  Through these experiences, I learned to love C# and what 
it offered, especially when used with Visual Studio.  

I recognize that Visual Studio is not everyone's cup of tea, but with recent changes MS has 
made to the platform, such as buying Mono, creating 
[Visual Studio Code ](https://code.visualstudio.com/){:target="_blank"}.  I'm actually using 
VS code to write this post, though that may be the definition of overkill.

I am also taking this time to learn a little about some other platforms, such as developing on Xbox and mobile software (using C# for Android and iOS development).  My goal is that as I learn some interesting aspects to the language and the tools, I will share them with you.

Now, if I could figure out how this spell checker is supposed to work, that would be very nice.
